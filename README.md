# html-advanced-tabel
This project demonstrates how to design an advanced HTML table using only pure HTML (no CSS). The table showcases multiple header levels, row grouping, and column spanning to represent structured data such as quarterly scores.

===- Features -===
Multi‑row headers: Organize data with multiple header levels (main headers → quarters → sub‑scores).

Rowspan and Colspan: Combine cells vertically and horizontally to create professional‑style layouts.

Quarterly Scores Example: Showcases Q1–Q4 with multiple sub‑columns under each quarter.

Summary Rows: Demonstrates how to merge cells for company‑level averages.

Spacing Control: Uses cellspacing and cellpadding for clarity without CSS.

===- Purpose -===
To practice advanced table design with nested headers.

To demonstrate realistic datasets (employees, projects, quarterly scores).

To show how rowspan and colspan can be combined for clean, professional layouts.

===- Usage -===
Save the table code in a file, e.g. table.html.

Open the file in any web browser.

The table will render with multi‑row headers and structured data.
